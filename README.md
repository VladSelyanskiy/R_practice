# R_practice

This project contains R scripts, data analysis, and reports organized into two main directories: "Individual Task" and "Tasks". It is designed for practicing data analysis and modeling using R.

## Directory Structure

- **Individual Task/**  
  Contains files related to a specific analysis or project, including:  
  - R scripts (`.R`, `.Rmd`) for data analysis and modeling  
  - R project file (`Code.Rproj`)  
  - Dataset files (`diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv`)  
  - Model data (`model.RData`)  
  - Reports in Word and R Markdown formats (`Report Ind Task.Rmd`, `Report-Ind-Task.docx`)  
  - Additional scripts and notes (`short.R`, `Analysis.R`)

- **Tasks/**  
  Contains various practice tasks and datasets, including:  
  - R scripts (`testing.R`, `Practice.Rproj`)  
  - Data files (`mydata.RData`, `pt_data.csv`, `usedcars.csv`)  
  - Reports and documentation (`Report.docx`, `Report.Rmd`)

## Usage

- Open the R project files (`.Rproj`) in RStudio to work on the respective tasks.  
- Run the R scripts (`.R`, `.Rmd`) to perform data analysis and modeling.  
- Data files (`.csv`, `.RData`) are used as input datasets for the analyses.  
- Reports are available in Word and R Markdown formats for review and presentation.

## Dependencies

- R (version compatible with the scripts)  
- Recommended to use RStudio for project management and script execution  
- Required R packages should be installed as per the scripts' requirements (not explicitly listed here)

## Additional Information

- Documents such as `Отчет.docx`, `Отчет.pptx`, and `Дневник _практики.docx` are included for supplementary reporting and practice logs.
